The Hydrophilic nonporous  PU membrane transports perspiration to  the outside via solid state diffusion meaning  water molecules are carried through the  physical membrane as it seeks to maintain  heat and humidity equilibrium. This method of  moisture transfer does not suffer from foreign  object contamination such as mud, dirt and  salts from sweat unlike the more common  microporous membranes commonly found in  waterproof clothing.\nMultibuys\nBuy One Get One Half Price\nPartner Programme\nNo\nRecommended Use\nCycling, \nRunning, \nRunning / Training, \nTrail Running, \nWalking\nSale\nView\nView All Multibuys\nYes\nBrand\nBridgedale\nColour\nBlack\nGender\nUNISEX", "product_images": ["https://i1.adis.ws/i/jpl/go_101140_a", "https://i1.adis.ws/i/jpl/go_101140_b", "https://i1.adis.ws/i/jpl/go_101140_c", "https://i1.adis.ws/i/jpl/go_101140_d", "https://i1.adis.ws/i/jpl/go_101140_e", "https://i1.adis.ws/i/jpl/go_101140_z"], "product_meta": {"product_meta_title": "Bridgedale StormSock Lightweight Ankle Socks | GO Outdoors", "product_meta_description": "Close-fitting, waterproof ankle socks that give you maximum breathability with minimal insulation.", "product_meta_keywords": ""}, "product_misc": {"107636": {"data-id": "10", "data-dc-stock": "30", "data-store-stock": "33", "data-variation-id": "107636", "data-stock": "30"}}}},
